# beermate

## Coding Challenge
This repository was created using Nuxt.js as part of an interview coding challenge. This is my very first project with Nuxt.js and only the 2nd project using Vue.

## The task
Build a simple beer app, that uses the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). The user should be able to enter his preferred maximum ABV(alcohol by volume) value into an input field and should receive a table of all beers with an ABV less than the given one. The user should only see the input form when there is no results table. And the table should only be displayed if there are actually results for the request.

## Add On's
I decided to include a small "About" section, that gives information about the app and that also gives the user the opportunity to get a random beer displayed. 


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
